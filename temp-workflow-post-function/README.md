# Forge Hello World

This project demonstrates the Jira Workflow [Post Function](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-advanced-issue-workflows/#Post-functions) from the [jira:workflowPostFunction](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/jira-workflow-post-function/). 

See [developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.

## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## Quick start

- Modify your app by editing the `src/index.js` file.

- Build and deploy your app by running:
```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
forge install
```

- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally:
```
forge tunnel
```

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
